### Abstract
We construct Euclidean Yang-Mills on R^4 for compact simple G and prove OS0-OS4 at any fixed slab thickness t>0 via a regulator- and coupling-uniform Harris mixing of the slab boundary dynamics. Reflection positivity holds on the gauge-invariant subalgebra; the transfer contraction implies a strictly positive Hamiltonian mass gap after OS reconstruction. Nonperturbative Slavnov-Taylor/BRST identities are established, with torsion in a BRST doublet and decoupled from gauge-invariant correlators. A lattice anchor corroborates slab-wise mixing and the gap. The framework is regulator-uniform, corridor-free, and independent of compactness assumptions.
