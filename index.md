# Emmanouil Karolos Cizek (Čižek)

Research hub for my constructive programme on the **4D Yang–Mills mass gap** (Clay Millennium Problem context), OS reconstruction, and regulator-uniform mixing methods.

### Abstract
We construct Euclidean Yang–Mills on ℝ⁴ for compact simple gauge groups (e.g., SU(N)) and prove OS0–OS4 at fixed slab thickness \(t>0\) via regulator- and coupling-uniform Harris mixing of the slab boundary dynamics. Reflection positivity holds on the gauge-invariant subalgebra; transfer contraction implies a strictly positive Hamiltonian mass gap after OS reconstruction. Nonperturbative Slavnov–Taylor/BRST identities are established, with torsion in a BRST doublet and decoupled from gauge-invariant correlators. A lattice anchor corroborates slab-wise mixing and the gap. The framework is regulator-uniform, corridor-free, and avoids compactness-based arguments.
